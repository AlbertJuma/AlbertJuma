# Hi, I'm Albert Juma

I'm an autodidact with a strong interest in Mathematics, Programming, and Algorithms.

Currently learning Full Stack Web Development through freeCodeCamp.  
I focus on building real-world tools, writing clean code, and solving problems through logic.  
Belief: "From math to code, from logic to solutions—that's how I understand the world."  
Open to collaborating on beginner-friendly, educational, or problem-solving projects.  
Reach me at albertjuma450@gmail.com  
I enjoy learning that challenges how I think—it's training for the mind.  
Languages and Tools: JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python, Git, Node.js, MongoDB  
Also exploring local AI model tuning with Ollama.
