 # Hi there, I’m Albert Juma 👋

## Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a passionate learner on a journey to master **Mathematics**, **Programming**, and the logical art of **Algorithms**.

- 🌱 Currently learning **Full Stack Web Development** through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- 👀 I’m interested in turning code into real-world tools, logical thinking, and solving problems through elegant algorithms
- 🧠 My belief: *"From code to algorithms, from maths to logic—this is how I understand the world"*
- 💬 Let’s grow together—ask me about what you're learning!
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly, educational, or problem-solving projects
- 📫 Reach me: **albertjuma450@gmail.com**
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy learning things that challenge how I think—it’s like training the brain gym-style
