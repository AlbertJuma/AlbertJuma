Hi, I’m Albert Juma.

I’m a self-taught learner interested in Mathematics, Programming, and Algorithms. I’m currently learning Full Stack Web Development through freeCodeCamp.

I enjoy solving problems with code and building simple, useful tools. I also like exploring new ideas that challenge how I think.

I use JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python, Git, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I’m currently trying out local AI tools like Ollama.
